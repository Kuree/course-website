        name: Temperature monitoring system with Particle boards and GCP
        info: >-
            We will build an end-to-end system with temperature sensors, Particle IO,
            and Google Cloud Platform. At the end of the lab, we will deploy the IoT application
            to the App Engine and visualize the result.

        name: Smart Camera with RPi
        info: >-
            We will build a CNN fine-tuned for face detection and then deploy it on a Raspberry Pi
            + Camera. The Smart Camera will send a snapshot to the GCP whenever it detects a face,
            and then notifies the users.
