# Course schedule
- 
    day1: Intros, Objectives, etc. Web application design
    day1-intro: >-
        In this class we will discuss overall architecture, evolution of embedded systems and how connected devices can be used to build a complex system.
        We will also discuss basics of Javascript. What is an API and how to define it? What is serverless architecture? 
    day2: Introduction to particle.io system
    day2-intro: >-
        Understand high level IoT style architecture. Setting up the Particle
        board and be able to build
        simple particle program&#58; Control blinking frequency of an LED.
-
